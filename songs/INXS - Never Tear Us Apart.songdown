Verse 1:
      Am               F
Don't ask me, what you know is true
              Dm          F
Don't have to tell you, I love your precious heart
>>>

Chorus:
C        F
I
      C        F
I was standing
         C        F
You were there
           C        F
Two worlds collided
               G
And they could never tear us apart
>>>

But if I hurt you, I'd make wine from your tears

I told you that we could fly
Cause we all have wings but some of us don't know why

Chorus-
I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever, tear us apart
