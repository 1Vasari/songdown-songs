O little town of Bethlehem
    G        D7       G
How still we see thee lie
          E7       Am
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

The silent stars go by
           D    Em      B7
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
    Em   D    C      Am  B7
The ev - er - last - ing Light

The hopes and fears of all the years
    G      D7        G
Are met in thee to - night
